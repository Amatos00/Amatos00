### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

<b><p align="justify">
In the process of career transition. I was studying Mechatronics and in college I had the first contact with programming in C language, it was passion at first sight, from there I decided to change the area. I am looking for software development with the Javascript stack. I have knowledge of HTML, CSS and JS. Now I am studying React, Node and React Native in addition to studying Analysis and Systems Development. I work outside the area but I am completely open to new opportunities.
I started studying the rocketseat Gostack bootcamp.
